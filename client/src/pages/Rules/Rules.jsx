      <p>
        Welcome to the guys joining us for golf for the first time! Here's
        information we hope will make your golfing a bit more enjoyable. Each
        day we have competitive games. All competition is based on what you
        shoot against your own the average score (or what you told us you
        shoot).
      </p>

      <p>
        Each day has prize money, so make sure to bring your A game. You have
        already anteed up when you paid for your golf.
