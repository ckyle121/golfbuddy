        <p>
            Welcome to the guys joining us for golf for the first time! Here's
            information we hope will make your golfing a bit more enjoyable. Each day
            we have competitive games. All competition is based on what you shoot
            against your own the average score (or what you told us you shoot).
        </p>

        <p>
            Each day has prize money, so make sure to bring your A game. 
            You have already anteed up when you paid for your golf.
